# Covid Heat Map and Self Analysis Tool
The Covid 19 Self Assessment and Heat Map tool is a platform for students of Stockton University to quickly and accurately assess any Covid-19 related symptoms.

## Description

As enforcing social distancing is important for both the population in general and more specifically the university, the tool will provide a dynamic heatmap to indicate which areas of a geography are experiencing a high concentration of likely Covid-19 cases. All users with access to the tool will be able to make informed decisions about their health as it relates to travel patterns which will in turn contain the spread of the disease and allow institutions (ex. Stockton University) to return to normal operations in a timely manner. 
In addition to providing a heatmap, the tool will also provide a platform for users to perform a “self-assessment” of their symptoms. The self-assessment will be a questionnaire that allows users to determine if their symptoms may be related to Covid-19, the system will provide a “risk-score” for each user which will be indicative of if they should seek professional medical treatment and testing.
